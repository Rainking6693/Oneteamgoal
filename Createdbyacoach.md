CREATED BY A COACH



FOR COACHES, THAT WANT TO KEEP FUNDRAISING SIMPLE



Coach and Son

Graphic Designer by trade, I’ve spent years coaching football and other various sports in my free time. Coaching has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life as a father and member of a community, but has also been challenging in many ways. It takes a lot of research, organizing, and patience.



The most rewarding aspects of team sports is the collaborative effort of each player, parent, team managers, and coaches, all working together to have a successful season. I love watching a team meet it’s goal together with one collective effort.



It is definitely that way when it comes to fundraising. Something that I never enjoyed doing as a coach. One Team Goal was my solution to finding a way to raise money and create something that would rally our fans and supporters behind one important cause. That cause is to give our kids a rewarding, fun, and successful experience with our team.



One Team Goal was created by a coach for a coach that wants to spend time coaching, and not fundraising. Let’s keep it simple is my philosophy!



ONE TEAM, ONE GOAL, ONE REWARD!
